## Features

The content of the application is organized as a comprehensive library of historical lessons available to individuals inspired by knowledge from the past. It includes quizzes for testing what has been learned and public leaderboards for the best-performing users on the quizzes.

## Technology Stack

- **Laravel Framework:** The application is built using the open-source Laravel PHP framework, which follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, providing separation between data, presentation, and logic layers, contributing to code organization and easy application management.

- **Database:** Data on the server side is stored in a MySQL database administered using the Phpmyadmin tool within the XAMPP environment.

- **Front-end:** The front-end of the application is developed using programming languages such as HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX. JavaScript and JQuery are used for client-side element retrieval and content validation, while AJAX is used for adding, deleting, and modifying page content.

- **Galleries:** The "splide.js" library is used to display graphical content on the site, providing a modern gallery design for slides. Thanks to this tool, most slides on the page can elegantly display as many lessons as the site can offer.

- **Presentation:** The "Reveal.js" library is primarily used to present detailed lesson content. This "Reveal.js" tool is used to generate presentation-style content over the lessons, creating an immersive learning experience akin to a cinematic mode that helps users master content in an enjoyable way.
